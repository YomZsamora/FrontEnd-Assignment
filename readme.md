# Front-End Assignment
A simple frontend assignment with a site screenshot to emulate. Site frontend uses same layout, navigation and system as the screenshot. Images used were provided. This is basically a frontend design, hence no need for backend configurations. Though I'd like to note I used Laravel, PHP to be precise. To save you the hassle of configuring a development environment, download the HTML & CSS files here.

# GitSearch

GitSearch is simply an Angular App that uses Github API to retrieve user data. Submit a username and it gives you repository details of the user, including number of repositories, commits and branches and also when it was last updated.

## Requirements

Both the CLI and the project have dependecies that require Node together with NPM. So make sure you have these installed and working before proceeding.

##### Installation

- Clone this repository to a location in your file system.
- Open terminal command line then navigate to the root folder of the application.
- Run `ng serve` command.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser.
